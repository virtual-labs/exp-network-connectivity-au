### About the Experiment 

The "Modeling Synaptic Network Connectivity" experiment explores how neurons form complex networks through synaptic connections. Using interactive simulations, learners can visualize and analyze how parameters like connection probability, network topology, and synaptic strength influence the structure and function of neural circuits. This experiment provides foundational insights into computational neuroscience and brain network dynamics.
